Depending on A1C control and toleration, patients may stay there or move to 1mg/week, evaluate, and move to 2mg/week.\n\nFor Wegovy, the dosing also starts low and works up to reduce harshness of side effects. They always come in 4 week courses per dose and a patient may escalate to the next one each ~~week~~ month. Hypothetically to achieve best weight loss we want to see 2.4mg/week but if weight loss is sufficient a patient may stay at lower doses. The doses available are 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, 1.7mg, and 2.4mg.\n\nWhy would Rybelsus be a magnitude of strength higher, on top of being taken 7 times per week? Oral bioavailability. When absorbed via the GI tract, food and medication are brought via bloodstream to liver. For Rybelsus, the liver breaks down a large proportion of the medication. So somewhere between 49-98mg of Rybelsus every week gives about the same benefit as 0.5mg Ozempic per week.",

Since obesity is unlikely to ever get broad coverage, they are trying to show efficacy in as many obesity related conditions as possible: cardiovascular risk, Heart failure, MASH/NASH, apnea, and all kinds of stuff. This is all to get back door insurance coverage for an obesity drug.\n\n\nInsurance companies are going to put massive restrictions on Wegovy and Zepbound, where you'll need to jump through hoops to prove of one these diseases (once they receive the indication from the FDA).
