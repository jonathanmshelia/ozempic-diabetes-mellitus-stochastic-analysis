And remember that it often is started as carbohydrates are being greatly restricted, and that help a lot with weight loss. So, it really is pretty natural in the ways it works for weight. And weight is worthy taking an effective path to loss, because it is a huge factor in blood glucose. We only recently discovered the mechanism through which obesity increased blood glucose. Weight loss is often the most striking and encouraging source of blood glucose numbers for new diabetics. And you need some early successes, because it won't always be that easy, and I think progress tends to slow as the numbers come down.\n\nAll of that reduction in blood glucose will also help with cholesterol. Excess blood glucose damages blood vessel wall, and the body, being pretty good at this sort of thing, produces more cholesterol to repair that damage. There was a time lag, but within a few months of getting decent control of my blood glucose, by cholesterol numbers dropped significantly. Sugar is poison, and everything we to helps. \n\nI so now take Monjaro, which adds a combines a second similar action. Both work. \n\n(You can do some research, but all I have learned, particularly recent studies, confirms my that cholesterol is a sign of sugar damage and my refusal to use statins to suppress exactly the body process meant to do repairs.)",

My own experience is purely anecdotal and so would not be accepted as scientific argument, but it vividly supports that view. \n\nIf that is correct, of course cholesterol is associated with heart disease. It follows the damage, attempting to make repairs, but it's a response, not a cause. \n\nI will let some fairly recent studies speak to the issue. They involve both the relationship of cholesterol levels to all-cause mortality but also analysis of the statistical fraud that largely created the prevailing medical dogma. The misuse of statistics has long been pointed out. Medical journals are just now becoming willing to point out the error in an overwhelmingly common medical practice. This matters, because statins are not harmless. Neither are many medications, but there should be some significant benefit to go with the potential harm.\n\n**How statistical deception created the appearance that statins are safe and effective in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease**\n\nWe have provided a critical assessment of research on the reduction of cholesterol levels by statin treatment to reduce cardiovascular disease. Our opinion is that although statins are effective at reducing cholesterol levels, they have failed to substantially improve cardiovascular outcomes. We have described the deceptive approach statin advocates have deployed to create the appearance that cholesterol reduction results in an impressive reduction in cardiovascular disease outcomes through their use of a statistical tool called relative risk reduction (RRR), a method which amplifies the trivial beneficial effects of statins. We have also described how the directors of the clinical trials have succeeded in minimizing the significance of the numerous adverse effects of statin treatment.
