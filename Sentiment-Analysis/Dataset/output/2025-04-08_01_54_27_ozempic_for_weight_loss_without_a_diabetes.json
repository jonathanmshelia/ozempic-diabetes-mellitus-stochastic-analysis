        "body": "Personally I don't believe any doctor should be prescribing Ozempic for weight loss.  They should stick to Wegovy, which is the same drug, but specifically sold for weight loss.  Many,  many diabetics are unable to get their Ozempic, approved only for type 2 diabetes,  because so many are using it for weight loss.   This drug has saved me! I was able to get off of insulin and drastically lower my A1C. Now,  I have to worry if I'm able to even get it. This last month I had to drive over an hour away to get it,  and I live in a major metropolitan area.   I got the last of what the store had and none of the pharmacies could get more due to manufacturer shortage.. all due to the off label use of this diabetes drug for weight loss. \nPlease wait for Wegovy and leave the Ozempic for the diabetics.",

        "body": "Hi there, OP! I have relatively similar stats to you..I'm 27F with a starting BMI of almost 33.  I am 5'5\" and my highest weight was 196 pounds back in May of this year, when I started to see a weight management doctor. She also recommend that I try a weight loss medication, more specifically Ozempic (wanted to prescribe me Wegovy, but there is even more of a shortage of that medication apparently). I also am not diabetic or prediabetic, and my fasting glucose is always normal and I have an A1C of 4.7 the last time it was checked. I have been on Ozempic for five months now, and have not had any major side effects, besides the occasional slight headache and very minor bouts of nausea. It's absolutely nothing that I can't tolerate, and I don't notice it much anymore, if at all. This morning I weighed in at 157 pounds, which is an all time low for me- almost 40 pounds down in exactly five months. I have a relatively sedentary lifestyle too, doing a few activities here and there but really have only been to the gym one time since beginning Ozempic. My point in saying that is, I have definitely realized that you don't have to incorporate exercise into losing weight, as it's mainly diet and calorie deficits that truly help. Being on Ozempic makes me feel satiated faster and much longer than before. I definitely have less urges and cravings for unhealthy food, and when I eat too much now I actually get nauseated and turned off by food if that makes sense. For me personally, Ozempic has been an absolute lifesaver and the best medication I have ever been on. Thankfully my insurance (somehow!?) covers it too, and I only pay $25 for a month's supply. I have my next weight management appointment in a month, and I am so excited to update my doctor of my progress and hopefully I can continue to use Ozempic for weight loss until I reach my weight goal, since I'm so close!\n\nAnyways, my point being..I honestly can't recommend Ozempic enough, especially if you have a doctor willing to prescribe it to you with no other underlying health conditions besides being overweight and especially if your insurance covers it! If you have any other questions at all, let me know. I would be happy to answer them! Good luck with your weight loss journey, OP..all the best! :)",
