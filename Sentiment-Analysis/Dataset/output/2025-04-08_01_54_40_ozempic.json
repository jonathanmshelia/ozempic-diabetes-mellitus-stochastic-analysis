Even a lot of Type 2 diabetics place emphasis on the weight loss being what has helped lower their blood sugar.\n\nI've been finding it hard to research online and find out whether it actually does something chemically to alter blood sugar in and of itself, separate from causing weight loss that causes metabolic change causing lower blood sugar. \n\nI'm overweight but not by a huge amount (BMI of 26) so I know I won't benefit from the stereotypical dramatic huge weight loss that lots of people taking it seem to do. As I'm already on Vyvanse for ADHD which is also an appetite suppression, I'm not sure whether Ozempic would be redundant, if it doesn't actually chemically do anything to blood sugar, just suppresses appetite.",
