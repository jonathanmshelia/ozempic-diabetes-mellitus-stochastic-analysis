        "body": "Same here. I'm obese medically for my height 88kg and 164 cm tall. I've been put on Ozempic for pcos related illness and weight gain. I was diagnosed with pcos when I was 63kg (normal weight range), but not put on anything due to the fact that I was gyming and had a fair amount of muscle mass, but still has hormonal other issues , I was baffled that I was insulin resistant because of my normal weight. A back injury and diagnoses with arthritis led to me not gyming due to acute pain and inability to go through life with back issues, I tried again to fail miserably due to pain. The amount of shame from Pharmacists is disgusting. I hate this narrative going on that Ozempic is being hoarded by non diabetics and narcissistic people. We are ill too and have every right to preventative care to avoid heart disease and death due to obesity. I'm prime example of if a disease affects you due to genetics and other factors, it doesn't matter what you currently weigh when diagnosed, you will feel the effects of pcos, IR and prediabetes still. I've gained all this weight. The food chatter is unliveable with and most people forget that IR people suffer from constant hunger because the insulin isn't being effectively carried to their cells. It isn't a case of \"just stop eating\". If you just stopped eating, you would feel like you're starving and going insane with food chatter. I hate this narrative of OP. I understand pharmaceutical companies are milking the situation as much as they can. But it's not other ill people's fault. I'd you're diabetic and it's genetic, we are IR AND IT'S ALSO genetic. They haven't just \"stopped eating\" to not become diabetic. So why should we as IR people just take \"stopping eating\" and healthy diet as a feasible solution, it doesn't always work. There are other factors too, like inflammation, stress etc. This doesn't absolve the people taking it that are not diagnosed with anything and are just looking for a quick fix for 10kg or less. That's just on the spectrum of ridiculous",

I'm  also sorry you have been mistreated. \n\nI'm  not defending  pharmacists in any way, but I just want to offer a different perspective of what role we play in the health care system. \n\n1. Pharmacists are there to regulate the movement of scheduled medicines. If a pharmacists suspects that there's misuse of any kind (and sometimes the suspisions are wrong but you have no idea how often we are right) they are well within their right to not dispense and investigate by calling the doctor, checking records  etc to ensure safe use. We are not allowed to change anything on the Rx but we can withhold medications if we suspect misuse within reason. Sometimes even \n doctors are questionable,it's quite tricky\n\n2.  For Ritalin (which is a schedule 6) there's is a very specific way that Rx must be written for it to be valid. One thing off ... you don't dispense, you investigate. \n\n3.  If you feel like a pharmacist is not performing their duty in a way, you have a right to lay a complaint with the South African Pharmacy Council. You can even ask for their contact info at the pharmacy. They are legally obligated to provide it. \n\n\nIt sucks when people who need help, get the brushed with the same brush as  those with illintentions, and I do agree that some pharmacists are absolute shits but most of us are just doing our best to honour our vows.",

Pharmacists are an essential part of the checks and balances of a good health care service, especially with how common prescribing errors are across all levels of health care. Pharmacists are not tellers in a shop. Unfortunately the attitudes here towards pharmacists show how our unmanaged private health care service has more in common with the US than we would like to believe.\n\nOf course, a bad attitude is a problem and professionalism is essential. Sorry about the experiences of those above. But questioning the off label use of a drug is an important part of a pharmacists job.\n\nFor those that don't know, Ozempic is registered for use in type 2 diabetes and for weight management when lifestyle changes have not been sufficient alone. Impaired glucose tolerance or 'pre-diabetes', even in PCOS, would not be an accepted indication in countries with tightly managed health care systems. This just has to do with the conditions where the drug has been researched and how evidence based medicine works.",

My grandfather was a strong, slim, healthy man who got it at 32ish. My dad got his before 30. My brother and I thought we were lucky to not get it (though I was prediabetic a few years back and decided to be more mindful of my health) - let me also state that I was offered ozempic and said 'no' because my bad behaviours shouldn't be solved by medicine necessary in a community that needs it for medical reasons (personal choice of course). \n\nSadly, despite both of us not getting it at 30, my brother was diagnosed with LADA (diabetes 1.5) which they know more about now. They reckon his was caused from getting COVID but they're also unsure if this is what my family has had for generations since they only just know more about it now... as it's often misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes. He managed to stay off of insulin for 4 years but has just been told his time is up and will be starting insulin now. \n\nThe world is not so black and white...

Many overweight people are in danger of becoming diabetic or are prediabetic so ozempic helps even if they're not diabetic right now. Being overweight is as much a life threatening condition to many as being diabetic is. They're right to seek out a medication that can help. Ozempic also helps with PCOS. Ozempic helps with other eating disorders as it reduces food noise. Which is why it also helps alcoholics.\n\nJust because a medication has an original intended use, doesn't mean it doesn't have many other life changing and sometimes life saving uses. The intended use case don't get to claim dibs. Everyone using it because they need it are right to do so. Yes there will always be some edge cases of people who truly don't need drug help, but use it anyway. But the simple truth is the cost of the drug is high enough to weed out the majority of those. Your anger is misplaced, and should rather be focused on the corporations exploiting your wallet by limiting supply and raising the price accordingly. Rather than directing it at people who are getting the help they need for their desperate situations.\n\nYou simply cannot pretend like your life altering illness is somehow more deserving of treatment than someone else's. Also not all ozempic products are created equal. While ozempic is used as the sort of catch all name for these products, they are not all the same and many people who say they're on ozempic are actually on wegovy.

        "body": "Question: Would you still complain if Ozempic was approved as an On-Label Weight-loss Medication? \n\nIt has shown efficacy in Weight-loss. The only difference is that the use currently is Off-Label in South Africa. Many medications started as Off-Label use for one reason or another, and their indications changed over time.  \n\nSildenafil, AKA Viagra, was a Hypertension Medication first, and the Erection induction was a side effect. It was then given off-label for a while for Erectile Dysfunction, well before it was approved for primary ED use.  \n\nOne day, Ozempic might become an Official, primarily Weight Loss medication, with the treatment of Diabetes as secondary. I don't want to diminish the impact that diabetes has on your life, and I empathise with you, but for many, being overweight and struggling to lose it is also very impactful on those people, too. They are candidates for all manner of illnesses that being overweight increases the risk for. Incidentally, Diabetes is a possibility.  \n\nJust like you're being unfairly judged by some people for your Diabetes Type 2 because \"you did it to yourself with your lifestyle choices,\" people who struggle to lose weight are similarly judged as being fat and lazy, who did it to themselves. I feel like there should be empathy for both sets of people.  \n\nAs for your complaint about the Price: That will sadly always be a factor, until the Patent expires. With no competition, Big Pharma gets to set whatever price they want. \ud83e\udee3  \nBig Pharma doesn't actually care about people. They care about profits. And if the Weight-loss market is more profitable than the Diabetic market, resulting in them raising prices, blame Big Pharma, not the people using the Drug.\n\nI wish you luck in finding the Drug, or an established (cheaper) alternative. I wish you good health, too. \ud83e\udec2",

For 1:100 people the side effects remain and they get other side effects too and are unlikely candidates to continue.\n\nHe further adds that it is a drug that if you stop and try and restart it becomes less effective every time so you want to stay on it for at least 2-3 years for you to have had enough time to lose the weight and your body being stable enough to ween yourself off of it without the weight piling back on.\n\nAt 3 years (36 months), thats ~R7,500 x 36 = R270,000 just to cover the drug cost (will probably be higher).",
