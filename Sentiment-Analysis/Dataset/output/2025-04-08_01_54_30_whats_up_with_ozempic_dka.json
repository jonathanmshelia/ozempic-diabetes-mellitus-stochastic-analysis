When I was still producing a lil bit of insulin I was put on trulicity and it was very effective but then my insurance wouldn't cover it even tho my Dr showed them how it was working for me. Then she put me on ozempic I was on that for a few months and it wasn't as effective but still helping some but then I had a DKA episode and she said it was due the other ozempic and took me off of it. I'm still trying to figure out how to combat this insulin resistant cause I take a crazy amount of insulin. My sister is type 1 and she takes a fraction of what I take.",
