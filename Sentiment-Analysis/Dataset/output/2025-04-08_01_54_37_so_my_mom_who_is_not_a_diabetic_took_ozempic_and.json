One Ozempic pen gives you 4 uses which is enough medication for 4 weeks. That means she took 3 weeks worth of medication at the same time. Not good. I sure hope she learned her lesson. She said she wont be doing this again. I sure as hell hope not because I will go off on her if she does.",

        "body": "Most diabetics will have fatty livers some non alcoholic fatty livers NAFL which is supposed to be reversible by reducing your carbon intake and only eating 800 calories a day. After a week or so of being super tired and sluggish on the 800 calories your body transforms into using fats for energy by turning the fat back to glucose. As you will be aware as a diabetic carbs turn into glucose real quick and there are those fast acting carbs like potatoes and bread (wheat) that can produce a huge amount of glucose in a short time. So when the body cant use all that energy up the body turns the glucose into fat and first stores it in the liver where it can easily turn it back into glucose. When the liver gets too fatty that's when the fat gets stored elsewhere like on the belly or around other organs like heart lungs etc. The body prefers carbs because its an easier source of energy and it burns real quick were as fat is not a quick source so the body doesn't use it and so when getting plenty of carbs it burns the carbs glucose and stores the harder to burn fat.\u00a0\nHumans need about 2000 calories a day to maintain our bodies and give us the energy we need to go about our lives but also to heal injuries and maintain our bodies and recover from sickness. But if we eat too many carbs in bursts it produces all these calories that we don't need all at once so any left over get turned to fat. If we ate smaller meals and snacked in between with healthy food then we may just get away with having less fat on our bodies and in our liver.\nIf we reduce our carb intake to as near as zero as possible and eat proteins healthy fats like dairy butter instead of vegetable oils etc and ate things like eggs but only 800 calories worth like I said you will feel sluggish and really tired for about a week but if you persist you will notice your energy levels will come back and the weight will drop off you. Your body is realising it cannot get enough energy because its getting no carbs so it decides because its getting healthy fats like butter and meats thats its having to use for the last week that it decides its going to work harder and burn the fats for energy from now on, but then realises its not getting 2000 calories worth from what you're eating so it withdraws fat stored in the body and burns it to produce the energy you need. The liver will be called on to release the fat stored in it to turn into glucose and then the liver will start working better and may even regenerate much better. It will then perform other functions better like healthy cholesterol production which will reduce cardiac problems as many of you know diabetics are at serious risk of heart disease heart failure and other organ problems like the liver kidneys heart eyes pancreas and problems with nerves in your hands feet and legs .\nIf you do this you may well turn your type II diabetes into remission and be able to stop all meds and have a much healthy life and be able to go back to eating the things you love (in healthy portions)\u00a0 without the glucose spikes.\n\n\nI had a NAFLD fatty liver and type II diabetes and even had to go on large doses of novarapid and Lantus background insulin every day. I then had a heart attack that didn't really cause any damage to my heart so I just had a stent put in. Four years later I had another heart attack sepsis and kidney failure and finally left the hospital being told 72% of the left side of my heart was scarred and therefore only functioning at 28% and I was at serious risk of cardiac arrest and arrhythmia that would be life threatening so I've had to have a modified complex device inserted into my chest in a pocket make by a surgeon cutting a part of my chest open and digging out the pocket to fit a defibrillator and a pacemaker\u00a0 and five wires going in and around my heart that hopefully will shock me back to life or correct any abnormal heartbeat if it happens.\nFinally I was referred to a hematologist (liver consultant) who tells me I have significant fat infiltration of the liver and 18% of my liver is now scarred or basically dead and I have stepped over into cirrhosis\u00a0 and the best thing I can do now is lose some weight to reduce the fat in my liver so that it can work better and hopefully preserve what function I have left.\nI mentioned that I have other health issues like fibromyalgia and chronic pain that makes it very difficult to exercise and therefore burn off glucose or fat and asked if their was a way of getting a prescription for ozempic and he said even if there was I would not be able to take ozempic because my liver couldn't handle it and it would be dangerous.\u00a0\nSo the point I am making is if your diabetic you will have a fatty liver and even those who are not diabetics could very well have fatty livers either non alcoholic or alcoholic fatty livers and you could be putting your health at risk by taking ozempic or any other weight loss injections.\nDo the low carbs 800 calories for a week and then start eating reasonable amounts of proteins and fats and your body will switch its energy source to the slow energy release burning of fat stored in your body and you will lose weight naturally and have better health",

Ozempic and Wegovy have the same active ingredient, but Wegovy is for obesity, and actually caps out at a higher dose limit for obesity. \n\nThe manufacturers have to put \"not for weight loss\" in the advertising because the ozempic version of the pen isn't FDA approved for that indication, but it's the exact same medication inside it.",

This mentality is the exact reason I fired this doctor. She nearly killed me. I was already hitting the gym 3 days per week with a trainer, archery on the weekends, eating low carb, and under 2000 calories per day,  tai chi 5 days per week. I told her something was wrong with my kidneys because I was putting on water weight. She said it was fat and I just needed to work out more and eat less. Even charted it. Turns out my kidneys were failing for the last 9 months before I fired her. Now my mom still has her as a doc because the doc \"hooks her up\" with Ozempic.
