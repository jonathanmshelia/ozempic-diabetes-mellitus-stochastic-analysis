Once off it, you have to work harder to maintain A1C and blood sugars. I reached my goal weight about 1 year in and have maintained since. Not completely by choice. I really wanted to lose about 10 more lbs. But its the stubborn fat I dont have patience for lol. As far as maintaining, I'm just continuing to eat the way I have been. 3 meals. 2 snacks. Making sure I'm eating healthy foods- nuts, veggies, fruit,  lean protein. Keeping it balanced.. very little dairy/fat. Staying away from or keeping them a minimum for fast/processed foods, anything that comes in a box. And then staying active. I still track everything i eat, my steps, water and calories burned. By still being on the mounjaro though, it helps curb my cravings and im not overeating. I'm on 7.5mg dose now. I had gone up to 12.5 at one point.",

If you lose the weight you need to lose and regain insulin sensitivity you can come off the drug and continue having results.

While it is possible to do this, the people who are capable of sustaining these habits without Ozempic would likely just have done so and they wouldn't have taken it in the first place. Since almost everyone who takes it to lose weight has tried to lose weight through some other method before. (Doesn't have to be just binge eating, it could also be more gradual overeating).\n\nI am a dietitian(though non-practicing) but based on my experience and knowledge I do share the opinion of this doctor. While Ozempic is a great drug that can be beneficial for a lot of people, it should not be prescribed too hastily. If a patient can improve their insulin resistance and keep of weight without it then that is preferable over taking Ozempic and they shouldn't take it in the first place. And if they can't then they should remain on Ozempic even after they lost their weight or they will gain it all back.",
