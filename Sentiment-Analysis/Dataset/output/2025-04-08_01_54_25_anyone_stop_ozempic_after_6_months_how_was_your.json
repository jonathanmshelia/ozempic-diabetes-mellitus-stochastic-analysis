        "body": "If you stop taking Ozempic after taking it regularly for 6 months, your blood glucose may rebound to around pre-treatment levels[1]. \n\nOzempic is a medication used to manage blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. It encourages the pancreas to release more insulin to bring blood sugar levels back down when they rise after a meal[3]. \n\nOzempic also reduces sugar production in the liver and slows down the digestion process, which helps people eat less and lose weight[3]. When people suddenly stop taking Ozempic, the amount of glucose in their blood can surge, which can be a big problem for diabetics[2][5]. \n\nAbruptly discontinuing Ozempic can lead to uncontrolled blood sugar levels, which can have adverse effects on your health[6]. Additionally, the weight loss that Ozempic can cause is likely to come right back once someone stops taking it[4][5]. \n\nIf you are considering stopping Ozempic, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider first to discuss the potential risks and benefits of discontinuing the medication.\n\nSources\n[1] What Happens After You Stop Taking Ozempic? - Everyday Health https://www.everydayhealth.com/diabetes/things-that-can-happen-after-you-stop-taking-ozempic/\n[2] Ozempic Can Cause Major Weight Loss.

And thanks to bad genes, a deep and wide family history of addiction, bad upbringing and an adult life of bad habits and bad decisions, dieting SEEMS impossible.\n\nFor the first few months off Ozempic I realized that my ENTIRE life I had been driven by a constant craving and was finally relieved of it on Ozempic. It was a relief to finally understand what it felt like to be satisfied by normal portion size. I never before understood how 1 cup (or less) of ANYTHING was a serving size.
