I didn't even realize I had diabetes, but I was having headaches headaches, passing out and was almost hospitalized. Metformin and diet changes prevented me from being on insulin. \n\nBut Ozempic has eliminated the desire to eat entirely. I wasn't actually a binge eater, so it allowed me to completely change every habit. It has also allowed me to make changes easier than before. We shouldn't be complaining. And instead we should be finding best practices. My doctor doesn't cut people off cold turkey. She means people off, often replacing the Metformin. \nShe makes sure people have replaced the habits.",

Then they wanted me to download an app. Then they wanted to assign me a \u201cHealth care team\u201d acted like they were gonna work closely with my PC. Basically two days into the app and their health care team they canceled the 90 days of Mounjaro that my pc physician had just called in and gave me a prescription of 1 month of Mounjaro with no refills. I was so upset. The diet they wanted me to do was basically keto and if I could do this on my own I would\u2019ve years ago. Needless to say I told them to F off. The labs came back saying my amylase and lipase were high and 1. I\u2019ve never had those tested before so I find it interesting that the one time it is tested they come back high and by twin health who was obviously hired to get me off the Mounjaro. :/ So my pc talked to some Mounjaro reps and upped my Mounjaro to 10 mg and I\u2019ll take those tests again in August to see if they are still high. I have no pain in my pancreas so I\u2019m betting they were never high and the labs in August say that. But absolutely anything related to Twin Health stay away from.

        "body": "This happened to me when I changed jobs and had to wait 3 months for insurance to kick in. I ended up with the same insurance co (UHC).  I knew I was leaving my job so I lowered my doses to get me through the 3 months. When my dr wrote the new prescription and I was denied, due to a great A1C. \n\nI wrote a letter of appeal and ran it through Chatgpt.\n\n I got my prescription. \n\n       \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo Whom It May Concern,\n\nI am writing to appeal the denial of coverage for the prescription medication Ozempic (semaglutide). As a longtime policyholder with your esteemed company, I am deeply concerned about the decision to deny coverage for a medication that is crucial for managing my diabetes effectively.\n\nI have been diagnosed with diabetes for nearly a decade and have struggled to maintain optimal blood sugar levels despite various treatment modalities. Over the years, I have diligently followed medical advice, adhering to dietary restrictions, exercise regimens, and medication protocols. However, it wasn't until I was prescribed Ozempic that I experienced significant improvement in my condition.\n\nI was initially prescribed Ozempic during my previous employment, under the coverage of my former employer's health insurance plan. When I transitioned to a new job four months ago, I anticipated a seamless continuation of coverage through my new employer's insurance plan. Unfortunately, due to the waiting period associated with the new policy, I found myself without insurance coverage for a brief period.\n\nIn anticipation of this gap in coverage, my healthcare provider prescribed a three-month supply of Ozempic to ensure uninterrupted treatment. This decision was made after careful consideration of my medical history and the necessity of maintaining stable blood sugar levels to prevent complications associated with diabetes.\n\nI understand that the cost of medications can be a significant concern for insurance providers, but I urge you to consider the critical nature of Ozempic in managing my diabetes. Prior to using Ozempic, despite the use of medications such as Metformin and Glimipiride, I struggled to achieve and maintain a hemoglobin A1C level below 6.5%. However, since starting Ozempic, I have seen a remarkable improvement in my A1C levels, which has contributed to better overall health and a reduced risk of long-term complications associated with diabetes.\n\nDenying coverage for Ozempic not only jeopardizes my health and well-being but also undermines the efforts made by myself and my healthcare team to manage this chronic condition effectively. As a responsible policyholder, I have always prioritized preventive care and adherence to treatment plans to minimize healthcare costs in the long term.\n\nI kindly request a review of my case and reconsideration of the denial of coverage for Ozempic. I am willing to provide any additional information or documentation necessary to support my appeal. Moreover, I am open to discussing alternative solutions that align with both my medical needs and the constraints of the insurance policy.\n\nPlease understand that access to Ozempic is not merely a matter of convenience but a vital component of my diabetes management plan. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated, as it directly impacts my ability to maintain my health and quality of life.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to a favorable resolution to this appeal.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSincerely,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",

I was told insurance no longer considers me diabetic.\ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f   Unfortunately,  science does.   I also have a friend that was so frustrated,  he went non compliant  so that he could be covered by insurance for a glp-1.   He had horrible side effects with medicines he has been on for years, and he is unable to tolerate,  but because it brought down his numbers a little *abd I mean a little), they refused the jump to glp-1.   Now, they approved it.  What is insurance doing? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

The $$$ is no longer on insulin, but glp\u2019s or gip\u2019s where the real profit is.\n\nI also have a sneaky feeling fda/drug companies are being a little hesitant about long term use because we still don\u2019t know the long term effects. They don\u2019t want to be sued like the tobacco industry. They\u2019ve already added another black box warning. \n\nThe moment they find you can live in the 6s they cut out everything that helped you get there. Anything expensive.",

I know it sounds like a big loss, but if she finds out she can manage her A1C just fine with metformin alone, that seems fine.\n\nWorst case, you can now just buy semaglutides through compound pharmacies- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nearly as hard to get - unsure the costs though. \n\nStress can affect blood sugar, so try to keep it all calm and roll with it til you can figure something out.",

We are already talking about it for this reason.
