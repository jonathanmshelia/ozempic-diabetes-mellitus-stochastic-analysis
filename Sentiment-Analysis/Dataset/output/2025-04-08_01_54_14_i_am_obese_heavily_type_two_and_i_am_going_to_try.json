If you can stomach some common side effects AND don't get any severe side effects as I did, would recommend.  \n\n\nBut Ozempic on it's own will not solve your problems. Died is the most crucial element of them all. If you keep living your old life. It won't change a thing in the long run.",

The food noise stopped almost immediately. I feel some occasional nausea but it\u2019s not constant. I also seem to feel tired after the shots. Beyond that, it has been a miracle drug!  My A1C dropped from 12.7 to 7.0 after 2 months. I had been taking 50 units of slow acting insulin. I am now down to 10 units and expect to be able to stop injecting insulin soon. I take a metformin pill (500 ml) once a day but nothing else. I have been on Jardiance in the past but stopped it when I started the insulin. I haven\u2019t lost much weight but am going up in dosage today so that might happen yet. \nI think you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised with it as long as you\u2019re able to tolerate it.

        "body": "I've been on Ozempic for about a year and a half now. Over the first twelve months, I lost 70 pounds and my glucose stabilized below 180 for the first time since I was diagnosed. My last A1C, in August, was 5.2, compared to 7.1 two and a half years ago and 6.5 when I started Ozempic. \n\nMy weight stabilized just under 170 lb about six months ago. While it's not at the \"ideal\" weight I was targeting (150 lb would drop me out of \"overweight\" in calculated BMI), it's below my primary and secondary targets, so I can be satisfied if it doesn't drop any further.\n\nAssuming the normal titration and dosing schedule, your first pen will last you six weeks, and all subsequent pens will last four weeks. This pattern does leave you with unused medication in one of the first two pens (the first two pens are the 0.25mg/0.5mg pens, and you take 0.25mg weekly for four weeks, then 0.5mg for four weeks, then you move on to the second-stage pen at 1mg per dose), which is okay, but you can fudge the titration a little bit (with your doctor's approval!) if you don't want to waste it.\n\nI didn't have much trouble with side effects, just some mild gastric discomfort for the first day or two after a dose; this lasted about six weeks total. A friend of mine had it much worse; she had horrible nausea for the entire first week after each dose increase, with decreasing periods of nausea after each subsequent dose at the same strength. Her doctor ended up stretching out her titration to help give her time without the worst side effects, which did slightly lessen the severity at subsequent dose increases. It took her two months at the full dose to get to no strong side effects, and several months later she's still having minimal effects immediately after each dose. So side effects are most definitely YMMV.\n\nThe strangest effect I had was one that many people swear won't happen: my tastes changed. I used to be heavily drawn to extremely sweet foods. The worst was my pint-a-day ice cream habit that I simply could not break. After about a month on Ozempic, my sweet tooth dried up. While I can still eat sweet foods, they don't satisfy me anymore, and I can't eat very much at one time. \n\nI'm far more drawn to savory and tart foods now. This is, of course, a benefit to my glucose control, but I still have to be careful, because my biggest starch weakness has always been bread, and I haven't lost any taste for that. I can't readily limit myself to only low-glycemic-index breads for a variety of reasons, so I'm careful to always combine them with plenty of protein and/or fiber to reduce the load. And since I was diagnosed with hypoglycemia nearly two decades before diabetes, my doctor and I agree that cutting out carbs completely or going keto would not be a good idea. I might stabilize with a keto diet after time, but for the first few months I'd be at high risk of dangerously low episodes.",

And suddenly it was like all of that went away It freed up so much of my brain to not be thinking and worrying about those things as much. I wish I could take that aspect of it and make it permanent. \n\nI watched a lot of TikTok videos, some people maintain that if your injection areas are farther away from your stomach you'll have less side effects. Like using an arm instead of the abdomen they noticed a difference. I tried that I did not notice a difference. \n\nSome recommended loading up on protein shakes the day or few days before. I did start drinking protein shakes more because I wasn't hungry but I did need to eat something and that seemed to be a happy medium. \n\nSome people would take things to deal with the side effects whether it was nausea, constipation, or diarrhea. But that's a definite check with your doctor thing. \n\nAnd they had some advice on how not to get sulfur burps and I have forgotten what that was, but you might want to look that up because it's a gross side effect.  \n\nAlso I take antidepressants and I think because my digestion was being slowed down so much it felt like I was having withdrawal side effects.  I think I wasn't absorbing the medication like I had been before. So that's something to keep in mind.",

I did have a little stomach discomfort here and there... and there was some mild constipation, but nothing too serious until yesterday. I had just gotten back from a Carnival Cruise and had spent 4 days sort of eating like an idiot. Burgers, pizza, pie, cake, you name it. I won't go into graphic details... but let's just say that I had the worse case of constipation I have ever had in my life. I could not sit without feeling the pain. I had to resort to... treatment options that I had not ever had to use in the past...\n\nWith that being said, semaglutide slows the digestion process... so constipation can occur. Don't expect the drug to do all the work for you. It will be important to actually eat better as well. Specifically... you need to make sure you are getting enough fiber, which is something that a diabetic should be doing anyway. So, try to find ways to eat more fruits and vegetables (depending of course on how well you handle fruit). I've noticed that when I eat bad while on Rebelsus, I feel the wrath from my stomach like I never have before... so that has lead to me eating better overall... because I don't want to be miserable. lol\n\nBut, I've lost 20 pounds so far. I found that I can't eat as much as I could before the drug. My blood sugar levels have improved dramatically. It has absolutely helped me... and I'd say that the side effects were worth it. Can't really predict how things will go for you however... everyone is different. I can say that, my doctor, who historically HATES weight loss drugs, is happy to prescribe these. He says that his patients, overall, get really good results.",
