Listen to your body! Beef Jerky is often the best since you can get it at any gas station and I would just have a couple pieces. Sometimes I'd bring an apple to work with me.\n\nThe first bit was tough but I drank an unholy amount of zero cal drinks. Zevia was my go-to. I now usually only have 1 or 2 per day. Also black coffee which im pretty sure im now addicted too.\n\nMy breakfasts are ground beef, eggs, and orange juice. I would buy 500g things of ground beef, cook it, and save half for tomorrow's breakfast. 4 eggs per day. I would also eat bananas and apples. Sometimes I swap the ground beef for steak. This much protein would keep me full long enough to get me through most of my day and then I would rely on zero cal drinks to get me to bedtime. Sometimes Ill eat the whole package of ground beef too and not save any.\n\nI think the biggest factor in my success has just been to not have any strict rules for myself. There is no guilt when I buy a treat for myself or go out to eat. I do tighten up on my food intake after doing so though and self control is something I have had to practice. Find zero cal drinks that you enjoy and they will become that treat! My mantra has been \"sheer willpower and determination\" and it has worked. You can do it if you want it bad enough! Something in me just snapped one day and I decided I didnt want to be fat anymore.\n\nSorry for the long reply but this is what has worked for me and I hope it helps!
