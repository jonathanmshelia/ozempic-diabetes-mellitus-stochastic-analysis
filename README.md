# Ozempic type 2 diabetes Stochastic Analysis project

This project "Ozempic type 2 diabetes Stochastic Analysis" aims to apply stochastic analysis techniques to evaluate the impact of Ozempic on the management of type 2 diabetes. This approach has the potential to yield deeper insights into the variability of patient responses to Ozempic and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of its treatment effectiveness and long-term outcomes.

### Business Need
With the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the growing use of Ozempic as a treatment. There is a need for a more in-depth understanding of how this medication impacts patients, considering the variability in individual responses and the uncertainty inherent in biological systems . Specifically, healthcare providers and potentially pharmaceutical companies could benefit from a clearer, probabilistic view of treatment outcomes such as HbA1c reduction, weight loss, and the risk of adverse events like pancreatitis . This understanding can aid in making more informed clinical decisions, optimizing treatment strategies, and potentially predicting long-term impacts on patient health and healthcare costs

### Problem statement
The problem statement for this project is the need to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Ozempic for managing type 2 diabetes using stochastic analysis techniques. Traditional methods might not fully capture the range of possible outcomes and the likelihood of their occurrence in a diverse patient population . The project aims to address this by employing methods like Monte Carlo simulations and potentially Markov models to incorporate the variability observed in clinical trial data and real-world usage. This approach will allow for a probabilistic assessment of Ozempic's impact on key health indicators (HbA1c, weight) and the potential risks associated with its use, providing a more nuanced understanding than deterministic models alone . The project also seeks to explore the feasibility of using aggregated data from published studies to conduct this analysis, given the challenges in accessing patient-level datasets .
